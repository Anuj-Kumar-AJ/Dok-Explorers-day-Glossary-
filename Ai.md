# AI/ML
Welcome to AI/ML glossary 

This glossary covers the most important and relevant terms related to AI/ML, and each term is defined

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Artificial Intelligence | The ability of machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. |
| Machine Learning | A type of AI that allows machines to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. |
| Deep Learning | A subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn and recognize patterns in data. |
| Neural Network | A computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, used in machine learning to learn and recognize patterns in data. |
| Natural Language Processing (NLP) | A subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages, including tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot conversations. |
| Supervised Learning | A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, and learns to predict labels for new, unseen data. |
| Unsupervised Learning | A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, and learns to find patterns and structure in the data without being told what to look for. |
| Data Science | The interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data. |
| Model | In machine learning, a mathematical representation of a system or process, used to make predictions or decisions based on data. |
